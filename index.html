            My name is Piotr and I'm 20-year-old (as for 2019) software developer from Poland. I've been creating utility programs and computer games in C++ since 2014. Currently I have quite a lot of experience in creating text-based and 2D applications. My biggest goal is to be able create all sorts of programs (games, simulations, etc.) that would cause positive influence on people to make the world a better place. I'm a creative person with powerful imagination. Programming is my passion and I'm often motivated to learn new things that would push my creative possibilities even further. I don't only 'code' my apps - I also plan and design them, and I have lots of ideas for programs (especially games) to create and mechanics to implement in them. I'm also interested in virtual reality technology. My biggest hobby is learning about various music genres.
